My goal is to conquer the planet. Strengths: -beautiful, -smart, -dangerous, -magnificent, -unique. I have a wonderful experience and I don't have a wonderful one either. I study and retrain regularly, not because I'm stupid, but maybe because all unused neural connections are destroyed over time. And the tools are changing. (And maybe stupid)

Infinite Learning

Englesh b2, but your system gived me only A elementery ). Grammar naci.
I usually go to english club every weekend and I got some expirience as an English teacher when I was in China.
sometimes I can hear different accents.
I spoke with native English man, and I was surprised by his accent.
I know how pronounce sounds th (muffled) and th (sonorous).
Usally, I don't need looking to keyboard, becouse I own the blind method of printing (ru and en).
And I'm best man in the world ).

Have a good day.

P.S.
I can give you only one advice, if you want to learn language, first what you should do, it begin to speak this language.
