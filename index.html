              My goal is to conquer the planet. Strengths: -beautiful, -smart,
              -dangerous, -magnificent, -unique. I have a wonderful experience
              and I don't have a wonderful one either. I study and retrain
              regularly, not because I'm stupid, but maybe because all unused
              neural connections are destroyed over time. And the tools are
              changing. (And maybe stupid)

              I can't show you my last projects, becouse a don't have the rights
              for it. Infinite Learning Englesh b2, but your system gived me
              only A elementery ). Grammar naci. I usually go to english club
              every weekend and I got some expirience as an English teacher when
              I was in China. sometimes I can hear different accents. I spoke
              with native English man, and I was surprised by his accent. I know
              how pronounce sounds th (muffled) and th (sonorous). Usally, I
              don't need looking to keyboard, becouse I own the blind method of
              printing (ru and en). And I'm best man in the world ). Have a good
              day.

              P.S. I can give you only one advice, if you want to learn
              language, first what you should do, it begin to speak this
              language.
